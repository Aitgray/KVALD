feat: Revert Dockerfile and simplify CMakeLists for compilation

Reverted Dockerfile to use the original pytorch/pytorch:2.3.1-cuda12.1-cudnn8-devel base image, removing problematic OpenCV source build steps. Simplified CMakeLists.txt to rely on find_package for all libraries, with explicit paths for OpenCV, NetCDF, and TIFF. Updated compile.sh to use python3 and removed LD_LIBRARY_PATH export. Also fixed undefined variables in prototypes/train.py and added OpenCV test files.
