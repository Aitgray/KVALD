feat: Convert Python prototypes to C++

This commit initiates the conversion of Python prototype code to C++.

Key changes include:
- **Model Conversion:** Transformed `prototypes/model.py` (UNet architecture) into C++ using LibTorch. This involved creating `include/kvald/model.h` and `src/kvald/model.cpp`, and updating CMake configurations to integrate LibTorch and enable CUDA support.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Converted `prototypes/synthetic_data.py` to C++ (`include/kvald/synthetic_data.h` and `src/kvald/synthetic_data.cpp`), using Eigen for numerical operations.
- **Data Loader:** Implemented `GlareDataset` in C++ (`include/kvald/data_loader.h` and `src/kvald/data_loader.cpp`) using `torch::data::Dataset`.
- **Training Logic:** Converted `prototypes/train.py` to C++ (`include/kvald/trainer.h` and `src/kvald/trainer.cpp`), including loss functions, metrics, and the training loop.
- **Proof of Concept:** Converted `prototypes/proof_of_concept.py` to C++ (`include/kvald/proof_of_concept.h` and `src/kvald/proof_of_concept.cpp`), integrating OpenCV for video processing, C++ threading, and the previously converted components.
- **Build System Updates:** Updated `CMakeLists.txt` files to include LibTorch, OpenCV, nlohmann/json, and cxxopts dependencies.
- **Main Application Logic:** Modified `src/main.cpp` to handle command-line arguments for training and video processing, and to load configuration from `config.json`.

This completes the core Python to C++ conversion for the provided prototypes.
