feat: Implement parameter tuning suggestions and update README

This commit implements several parameter tuning suggestions:
- **Increased Model Capacity:** Doubled feature sizes in the U-Net from [32,64,128,256] to [64,128,256,512] in `prototypes/model.py`.
- **Lowered Learning Rate:** Changed `train.learning_rate` from 1e-3 to 1e-4 in `prototypes/config.json`.
- **Increased Epochs and Batch Size:** Bumped `train.num_epochs` to 50 and `train.batch_size` to 4 in `prototypes/config.json`.

Additionally, the `README.md` has been updated to include the training metrics plot.
