# The number of input and output neurons will be the number of pixels of the input video
    # Not sure what to do for the hidden layer, perhaps the number of hidden neurons will be the magnitude of the range of brightness
    # Not sure if I want an activation function, if I do I'm not sure which I should use. I need to consider the goal
